I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Administration, where I developed an interest in technology and software development in startup cultures. In addition to my traditional studies, I'm also taking, and have already taken, extra courses in web and mobile development.
In my free time, I like competitive programming, software development and various web and mobile projects, watching movies and hanging out with my family.`;
